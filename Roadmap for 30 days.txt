### ✅ **Problem Statement (Explained in Detail)**

**Title:**
📊 **Apple Stock Price Prediction for the Next 30 Days**

**Objective:**
To develop a **time series forecasting model** that predicts Apple's stock prices **30 days into the future** using **historical stock market data (2012–2019)**. This predictive model is aimed to assist:

* Investors
* Traders
* Financial analysts

…by providing actionable insights from trends, patterns, and the impact of external market forces.

### 🔍 **Detailed Dataset Explanation (`AAPL.csv`)**

**Dataset Period:** 2012 to 2019
**Frequency:** Daily records
**Attributes:**

| Column   | Description                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Date`   | Date of trading                            |
| `Open`   | Opening stock price                        |
| `High`   | Highest price of the day                   |
| `Low`    | Lowest price of the day                    |
| `Close`  | Closing price (often used for forecasting) |
| `Volume` | Total number of shares traded              |

✅ The **target variable** is the **forecast of the closing price for the next 30 days**.

This is a **univariate/multivariate time-series regression problem**, depending on the model approach.

### 🧠 **Key Goals of the Project**

* Develop **time-series forecasting models** (ARIMA, SARIMA, XGBoost)
* Detect **short- and long-term trends**
* Analyze **external event impacts** (macroeconomic data, news, etc.)
* Perform **EDA** to extract patterns and insights
* **Deploy** an interactive forecasting app using **Flask/Streamlit**

### 🔧 **Modeling Workflow**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   * Convert `Date` to `datetime`
   * Sort and index
   * Handle missing values
   * Normalize/scale data
   * Create lag/rolling features

2. **EDA:**

   * Line plots (Close over time)
   * Distribution of returns
   * Moving Averages
   * Volatility analysis
   * Seasonality/Trend decomposition

3. **Feature Engineering:**

   * Rolling mean/standard deviation
   * Lagged returns (1-day, 5-day, etc.)
   * Volume spikes
   * External indicators (later)

4. **Modeling:**

   * Statistical Models: ARIMA, SARIMA
   * Machine Learning: XGBoost, Random Forest
   * Neural Options: LSTM (optional stretch goal)

5. **Model Evaluation:**

   * MAE, RMSE, MAPE
   * Cross-validation using rolling forecast origin

6. **Deployment:**

   * Build a simple Flask/Streamlit app
   * Input: Dates
   * Output: Next 30-day predicted prices
   * Plot historical + predicted trends
